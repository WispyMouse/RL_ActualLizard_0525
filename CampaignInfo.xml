	<Description txt="&#xD;&#xA;This is a single map experience for the ActualLizard FE Map Jame for May 2025. This jam's theme is &quot;Pride&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A local theater is going to be showing &quot;Bolt-Action Love&quot; a play celebrating Lakshmi Bana and Emma Strider's relationship in Telepath Tactics. Some people were ruined by Strider's efforts to overthrow vile institutions, and are upset at the idea of celebrating them. Rubble Rousers are smashing up the theater - go stop them!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a single chapter campaign. I used this to learn how to make maps in TiB. It features an queer playable cast, and the story is simple with more queer joy than anything negative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Credits: RatLantern; Theresea (writing, playtesting); Anastasia (writing commission); various friends for feedback on writing."></Description>
