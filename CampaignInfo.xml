	<Description txt="&#xD;&#xA;This is a single map experience for the ActualLizard FE Map Jame for May 2025. This jam's theme is &quot;Pride&quot;.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;A local theater is going to be showing &quot;Bolt-Action Love&quot; (a play I made up), which celebrates Lakshmi Bana and Emma Strider's relationship in Telepath Tactics. Some (terrible) people were ruined by Strider's efforts to overthrow vile institutions, and are upset at the idea of a play celebrating them coming to town. They're smashing up the place - go stop them!&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;This is a really lightweight, mostly lighthearted single chapter game. I used it to learn how the editor worked, and to make my first campaign map. It features an entirely queer playable cast, and the story is meant to be more about queer joy than anything negative.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;Credits: RatLantern; Theresea (writing, playtesting); Tacitus (map creation assistance); Craig Stern (creator of this game! also map creation assistance); Anastasia (writing commission); various friends for feedback on writing."></Description>
